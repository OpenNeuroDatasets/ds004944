## Overview

This dataset comprises recordings of intraoperative Electrocorticography (ECoG) from 22 patients undergoing resective epilepsy surgery.
For each patient, the dataset is organized into pre-resection recording (referred to as SITUATION1A) and post-resection recording (referred to as SITUATION2A).

We provide raw ECoG recordings for each patient and a derivative folder that contains all the main processing stages 
performed with our neuromorphic processing pipeline: [https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-3591328/v1](https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-3591328/v1).

The pipeline preprocesses ECoG recordings in real-time and performs Asynchronous Delta Modulator (ADM) encoding with a custom BCI2000 module.
The ADM-encoded data are processed by a hardware Spiking Neural Network (SNN). The SNN-encoded data are then used to detect epileptiform patterns in the ECoG.
The code to perform preprocessing and ADM encoding in BCI2000, together with the code to detect epileptiform patterns from SNN-encoded data, are provided at [https://github.com/CostaFilippo/BCI2000_DYNAP-SE.git](https://github.com/CostaFilippo/BCI2000_DYNAP-SE.git). 

In a previous publication, this dataset has been analyzed with a offline software algorithm: [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clinph.2019.07.008](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clinph.2019.07.008). 

The annotations of the epileptiform patterns detected with the offline approach are provided at: sub-\*/ses-SITUATION\*/sub-\*_ses-SITUATION\*_task-acute_events.tsv.

The annotations of the epileptiform patterns detected with the online neuromorphic processing are provided at derivative/sub-\*/ses-SITUATION\*/sub-\*_ses-SITUATION*_task-EV.csv.

## Data Formats

Details of the neuromorphic processing pipeline can be found at [https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-3591328/v1](https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-3591328/v1).

### task-BCI.dat

The BCI2000-compatible file contains the raw ECoG recording.

It can be streamed in real-time using the 'FilePlayback' BCI2000 module.

### task-ADM.csv

The ADM file is formatted as follows:

 - _pulseType_: -1 for DN pulse, +1 for UP pulse.

 - _pulseTime_: Time at which the pulse occurred.

 - _channel_: Channel in which the pulse occurred.

 - _band_: 0 for EEG band, 1 for HFO band

### task-SNN.csv

The SNN file is formatted as follows:

 - _time_: Time at which the SNN neuron activated.

 - _neuronId_: Number id of the SNN neuron. (referring to DYNAP-SE numbering convention from 0 to 1024) 

 - _neuronCounter_: Number id of the SNN neuron. (referring to sequential numbering from 0 to 40)

 - _moduleName_: Neural population (ACC_4_0; ACC_0_4), band (EEG; HFO) and module number (ch 0-7) of the neuron.

  * ACC_4_0 = ACC UP

  * ACC_0_4 = ACC DN

 - _moduleId_: Module number (0-7).

 - _channelId_: Channel for which the SNN neuron activated.

### task-EV.csv

The EV file contains annotations of the detected epileptiform patterns with the following format:

 - _time_: time of the detected event.

 - _channelId_: channel id of the detected event.

 - _location_:  channel name of the detected event.
